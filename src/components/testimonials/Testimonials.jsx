      review: 'Ayodeji Abidemi is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love. I met them while struggling with a challenging data structures problem, and within a few minutes, they managed to explain a concept I had been working with for days. They have a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. They are also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done and efficiently, Ayodeji Abidemi definitely the person for you.',
